<p>Setting up a Lagom development environment takes only minutes using an sbt template or Maven archetype as described in <a href="IntroGetStarted.html">Getting Started with Lagom</a>. Without any coding, scripting or configuration on your part, the templates set up the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>A hierarchical build structure with two example services. You can follow their pattern to begin creating your own services, right in the same project.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>The infrastructure necessary to run and test your services locally:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p>A <a href="KafkaServer.html">Kafka server</a> for handling messages.</p></li>
      <li>
      <p>A <a href="CassandraServer.html">Cassandra server</a> for handling persistence. </p></li>
      <li>
      <p>A <a href="ServiceLocator.html">Service Registry and Service Gateway</a> to support location transparency. </p></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>The configuration necessary to build and run the services and infrastructure.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After you have created a project using one of these templates, the <code>runAll</code> command starts all of the runtime components and you can test immediately. </p>
<!---The following illustrates the runtime infrastructure that comes out-of-the-box with the Lagom development environment. (diagram see slides 1-3) --->
