<p>Lagom provides both Java and Scala APIs. The Java API targets Java 8 and assumes familiarity with features such as <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html">lambdas</a>, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html">default methods</a>, and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html"><code>Optional</code></a>. Most of Lagom is implemented in Scala. But, this is an implementation detail that shouldn&rsquo;t concern you, even if you are developing with the Java API.</p>
<p>Lagom&rsquo;s <a href="ServiceDescriptors.html">expressive service interface declarations</a> let developers quickly define interfaces and immediately start implementing them.</p>
<p>Important APIs that you will use when developing with Lagom include:<br/>* <a href="ServiceDescriptors.html">Service API</a> &mdash; Provides a way to declare and implement service interfaces, to be consumed by clients. For location transparency, clients discover services through a Service Locator. The Service API supports asynchronous streaming between services in addition to synchronous request-response calls.<br/>* <a href="MessageBrokerApi.html">Message Broker API</a> &mdash; Provides a distributed publish-subscribe model that services can use to share data via topics. A topic is simply a channel that allows services to push and pull data.<br/>* <a href="PersistentEntity.html">Persistence API</a> &mdash; Provides event-sourced persistent entities for services that store data. Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) read-side support is provided as well. Lagom manages the distribution of persisted entities across a cluster of nodes, enabling sharding and horizontal scaling. Cassandra is provided as a database out-of-the-box, but other DBs are supported.</p>
